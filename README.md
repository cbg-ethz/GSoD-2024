In 2024, we submitted a [project proposal](proposal.md) to Google Season of Docs, to help us improve the documentation of our bioinformatics pipeline for analysis of next generation sequencing data of viral variants - [V-pipe](https://github.com/cbg-ethz/V-pipe).

Our project got accepted and with the grant we hired a [technical writer](http://vangeestconsultancy.com/) who updated and reorganized the documentation, wrote a new tutorial specific to the analysis of sequencing data of wastewater-based variants surveillance, and set up this documentation on Read the Docs.

The [case study](case_study.md) summarizes our experience.

We thank Google Season of Docs for enabling these improvements.
